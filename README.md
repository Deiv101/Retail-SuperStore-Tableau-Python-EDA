Retail data analysis is an analysis of everything in your business, from sales and inventory to customer data. It enables businesses to effectively track customer actions, like their purchases and foot traffic in the store- whether done in person or online. Since the advent of e-commerce, retail business has changed a whole lot more, as are other types of businesses. Use of data to increase profits has been in high demands than ever before; retail stores, small and big, now keep every bit of data available to make their online presence even more valuable and to score new buyers, and retain their regulars.
Data is accessible at nearly every touchpoint that consumers and retailers interact nowadaysâ€”including both online and offline. As a result, Smal and Medium Business (SMB) retailers can use insight collected from data to prepare for future store planning needs, including marketing, employee management, inventory control and more. In fact, SMBs can be even more agile and nimble in rolling out their analytics efforts and react more quickly to leverage data into a competitive edge.
